Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from England. Along with its long history, food is a quintessential component of Boston. Cuisine in Boston is similar to the rest of New England cuisine, in that it has a large emphasis on seafood and dairy products. Its best-known dishes are New England clam chowder, fish and chips (usually with cod or scrod), baked beans, lobsters, steamed clams, and fried clams.  


**The objective of this project is to locate and recommend which neighborhood of Boston will be best choice to start a Chinese restaurant and explain the rationale of the recommendations.**
